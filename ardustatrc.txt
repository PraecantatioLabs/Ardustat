pycommand: python

#The port that the ardustat connects to is equal to the "portconstant" constant + the ID #. The default value of 50000 is chosen because TCP/IP ports below 49151 can be registered with the IANA, meaning it is less likely that common applications that use TCP ports will use port numbers above 50000. You can change this value if the ardustat application's port numbers conflict with another application you are using.
portconstant: 50000

#"loggingpause" is the amount of time that the logging function waits during each iteration

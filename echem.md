#Ardustat
The Ardustat is  a standard USB-Arduino unit with a custom designed daughterboard to provide:

- A galvanostat with a current range from .1 microA to 10 mA
- A potentiostat with a potential range from 0 to 5V with 5 mV resolution or -2.5 to 2.5 V Range
T
he Ardustat is a three electrode system, but can be used in two electrode mode as well.

These features are provided from a single USB port on a testing computer. A node.js program interaces the ardustat with the computer, but you can use anything that speaks serial.

Each Ardustat costs ~$60 in parts and involves minimal, simple soldering (no surface mount parts, etc). The software runs on just about any modern platform (tested on Windows XP, 2000, Mac OS X, Ubuntu Linux, Fedora Linux).
